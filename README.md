# CSCI-665-Foundations-of-Algorithms
This course introduces the concepts of algorithm design and analysis. It provides with the intellectual tools to design, analyze, implement, and evaluate algorithms by covering a range of classical algorithms and their complexity.


Based on following algorithms:
Introduction, stable matching, asymptotic notation, Binary trees, heaps, Sorting, lower bound for comparison-based, Counting inversions, Recurrences, Greedy algorithms, Huffman coding, Intro. to Dynamic Programming, Interval scheduling, Knapsack, Longest increasing subsequence, Longest common subsequence
Sequence alignment, Matrix chain multiplication, Graphs, BFS, DFS applications, Minimum spanning trees, Shortest paths, Network flow
